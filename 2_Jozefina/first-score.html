				<p> Programmer skills level 0.000000001</p>
				<p> I guess you were taking this test while listening to your idol Azis.
				You most probably spent the night at Biad, throwing napkins around. You
				like drinking Savoy and Black Ram in expensive bottles while driving your
				BMW. You want to be a programmer only to impress chicks. Sorry to disappoint
				you but unless you use all that energy you have when you dance "kyuchek" for
				writing code, you'd better try something else.</p>
