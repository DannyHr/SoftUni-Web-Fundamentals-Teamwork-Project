				<p> You can't be a programmer.. you can't really be anything.
				You most likely sleep 16 hours a day and roll around your
				apartment the rest of your time. You don't like doing anything. 
				You like it when things get done by themselves. Why bother
				with programming? You'd be better off as a mattress tester.</p>
